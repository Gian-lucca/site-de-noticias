INTRODUCTION

This module is sponsored by DiputaciÃ³ de Barcelona.

Diba carousel slider module creates a block carousel based on Bootstrap carousel
features. The block is created programatically and is ready to use directly,
doesn't need views or configure extra modules. Enable and use it.

The carousel works with Bootstrap 3.x and 4.x templates, also tested with Drupal
Bootstrap and Drupal Barrio templates and sub-templates.

Supports any fieldable entity type like nodes, users, comments or media.
